# Credit Card Fraud Detection Machine Learning Models

## Business Problem Overview
With the rise of digital payment channels, the number of fraudulent transactions is going very high day by day. It has been estimated by Nilson report that by 2020 the banking frauds would account to $30 billion worldwide. It is difficult to manually predict fraudulent transactions which is also error prone 

## Problem Statement
Build machine learning models to predict fraudulent credit card transactions 

## Input Dataset
The data set includes credit card transactions made by European cardholders over a period of two days in September 2013. Out of a total of 2,84,807 transactions, 492 were fraudulent.  The data set has also been modified with Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to maintain confidentiality. Apart from ‘time’ and ‘amount’, all the other features (V1, V2, V3, up to V28) are the principal components obtained using PCA. The feature 'time' contains the seconds elapsed between the first transaction in the data set and the subsequent transactions. The feature 'amount' is the transaction amount. The feature 'class' represents class labelling, and it takes the value 1 in cases of fraud and 0 in others
